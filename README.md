# Hello, I'm Andr√© Valle üëã

## About Me
I'm a software developer passionate about creating innovative and efficient solutions. With over 10 years of experience in both client and server-side JavaScript, I'm always seeking projects that challenge me to grow and push me out of my comfort zone.

- üî≠ Currently, I'm working as the CTO of a digital marketing agency, developing high-performance websites with Next.js. I've created a CLI to automate the rapid development of websites and landing pages, making the agency's business model more scalable. The CLI defines a template from various themes we've developed for each market segment.
- ‚ö° Fun Fact: Programming has always been my hobby since adolescence, but I also enjoy playing the guitar, gaming online, and my favorite sport is Jiu-Jitsu.
